                Rick Sanchez from Earth Dimension C-137 is the widowed father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of Morty Smith and
        Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He
        frequently travels on adventures through space, visiting other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the
        third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old

            <p>In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature
        universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. The inhabitants cease doing
        this after one of their scientists does the same thing for his own universe, and discovers that this is what Rick has
        done to his universe. Rick remorselessly destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing
        everyone inside. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he
        dispose of it and create a new one.

                Rick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode "Something
        Ricked This Way Comes", where he outsmarts Satan.

                reveals his disdain for love in the episode "Rick Potion #9", in which he claims that it is "a chemical reaction
        that compels animals to breed".[5] When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family
        members, they abandon their original dimension, Earth Dimension C-137, (and their family in that dimension) for a new
        one. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love
        potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their
        place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension.
